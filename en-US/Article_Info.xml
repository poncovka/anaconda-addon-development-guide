      The Anaconda installer is a piece of software used to install
      &FEDORA;, &RHEL; and their derivatives. Since the installation is
      internally a complicated process and there are many aspects of the
      resulting system that need to be configured during installation it has
      been decided that the Anaconda installer needs to support dynamically
      loaded plugins (addons) that will be developed and maintained by other
      teams and people specialized in certain areas. This guide should help
      those people writting an Anaconda addon to get an insight to the
      architecture and basic principles used by the Anaconda installer as
      well as an overview of the API and helper functions provided.
